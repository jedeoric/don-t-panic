** BACKGROUND **
Way back in 1992, i wrote a BASIC 5K version of this Columns Style game.
It took one weekend to write, but alot of people seemed to enjoyed
it on the Oric.

** GAME **
The Game is based on 7 different falling shapes that must be alligned
in sets of three either horizontally, vertically or diagonally to clear
them.

Each Shape may either roll or stay once they land, these properties are
shown in the lists of shapes either side of the playing arena.

As the shape falls from the top of screen, they can be moved left or
right with the shift keys.
Hitting either wall will increase the shapes rate of descent.

However by keeping it "oscillating" without hitting the sides,
the object will not descend and will hover at it's current height!

The game finishes when the pile reaches eight high!

** GAME PROGRESSION **
As the game progresses, the speed of Shapes descent increases

** CONTROLS **
Shifts, Function or Control key to start.
Left Shift  - Move shape left
Right Shift - Move Shape Right

** SCORES **
The score is displayed in the top right, and reflect when a group
of 3 shapes have been matched. Different credits are given for each
shape.
